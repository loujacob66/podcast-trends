# Podcast Trends CLI

A command-line tool for importing and analyzing podcast download trends from Excel files.

---

## ðŸ“¥ Importing a New Spreadsheet

To reset and re-import a new `.xlsx` file:

```bash
rm -f logs/podcast_trends.db
python import_from_excel.py data/YourSpreadsheet.xlsx
```

This will:
- Load **all sheets** from the Excel file
- Normalize the data (title, code, date, feature, etc.)
- Store it in a local SQLite database at `logs/podcast_trends.db`
- Print how many rows are imported

---

## ðŸš€ CLI Usage

Main entrypoint:

```bash
./bin/podcast [COMMAND] [OPTIONS]
```

- `code` â€” 3-digit code if found (e.g. `021`)
- `date`, `year`, `month` â€” from filename or folder path
- `downloads_full`, `downloads_partial`, `eq_full` â€” calculated metric
- `file_ext`, `size_per_download`, `url`
